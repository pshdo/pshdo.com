I recommend finding time to watch Jeffrey Snover and Kenneth Hansen's [Desired State Configuration in Windows Server 2012 R2 PowerShell](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/MDC-B302) talk from TechEd 2013.  Desired State Configuration is a way of specifying, via new PowerShell language features, how you want a server to get setup and configured.  PowerShell then takes that configuration data, and applies it on the server or servers of your choice. It looks like a great piece of technology.  

Remember, *keep your configuration and your scripts separate*.
