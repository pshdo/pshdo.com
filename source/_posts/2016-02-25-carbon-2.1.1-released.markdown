[Carbon](http://get-carbon.org) 2.1.1 is out. You can [download Carbon as a .ZIP archive, NuGet package, Chocolatey package, or from the PowerShell Gallery](http://get-carbon.org/about_Carbon_Installation.html). It may take a week or two for the package to show up at chocolatey.org.


## Bug Fixes

 * Fixed: unable to publish module to PowerShell Gallery because `RequiredAssemblies` module manifest data used an absolute path generated with `Join-Path` and `$PSScriptRoot`, which aren't allowed in module manifests.
 * Fixed: missing PowerShell Gallery tags, license URI, project URI, and release notes metadata.
 * Fixed: copyright date in module manifest is 2015.
 * Fixed: PowerShell gallery missing function list.
 * Fixed: Restricted user accounts can't import Carbon ([issue #180](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/180)).
 * Fixed: `Carbon_Privilege` DSC resource fails to remove all a user's privileges ([issue #178](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/178)).
 * Fixed: `Remove-IniEntry` fails to remove last INI entry in a file ([issue #179](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/179)).
