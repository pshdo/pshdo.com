In Feburary 2011, I finally got tired of using MSBuild as a scripting language.  There are great frameworks out there that make it bearable, but trying to use a build language to script and program is a recipe for disaster and bloated scripts. 

I don't know what finally motivated me to learn PowerShell.  I ordered every PowerShell book from the library, but returned them as soon as I started Lee Holmes' [PowerShell Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528492.do). Within a few days, I was writing scripts.  A year later, I have a hard time writing MSBuild.

I'm still kicking myself for waiting as long as I did.  I had heard lots of respectable developers extol PowerShell, but I never set aside the time to learn it.  What a waste.

If you're a .NET developer, and still using cmd as your command prompt, or even worse cygwin (shudder), shame on you!  Take a deep breath, two days off, and read Lee Holmes' book.  You'll never look back.
