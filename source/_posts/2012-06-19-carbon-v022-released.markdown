I've released Carbon v0.2.2.  [Download it from BitBucket.](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/downloads)  There were a bunch of documentation improvements, along with the following:

## Enhancements

 * Created Import-Carbon script to help users properly import Carbon.
 
## Bug fixes

 * Add-GroupMembers fails to add Administrators and ANONYMOUS LOGON built-in accounts.
 * Add-GroupMembers fails when adding built-in accounts multiple times.
 * Add-GroupMembers fails to add domain user to a local group.
