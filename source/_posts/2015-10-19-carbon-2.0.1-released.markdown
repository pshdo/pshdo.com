[Carbon](http://get-carbon.org) 2.0.1 is out. You can [download Carbon as a .ZIP archive, NuGet package, Chocolatey package, or from the PowerShell Gallery](http://get-carbon.org/about_Carbon_Installation.html). It may take a week or two for the package to show up at chocolatey.org.


 * Fixed: errors importing Carbon when IIS not installed on Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 10 (fixes [issue 168: Cannot import Carbon 2.0 module due to issues with IIS related functionality](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/168)).
 * Fixed Carbon copyright statements.
 * Improved Carbon's module description.
