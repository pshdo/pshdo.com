[Carbon](http://get-carbon.org) 2.3.0 is out. You can [download Carbon as a .ZIP archive, NuGet package, Chocolatey package, or from the PowerShell Gallery](http://get-carbon.org/about_Carbon_Installation.html). It may take a week or two for the package to show up at chocolatey.org.


## Enhancements

 * `Protect-String` can now encrypt with a key, password, or passphrase (i.e. it can now encrypt with symmetric encryption).
 * `Unprotect-String` can now decrypt with a key, password, or passphrase (i.e. it can now decrypt using symmetric encryption).
 * `Set-HostsEntry` now supports IPv6 addresses ([fixes issue](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/181/community-set-hostsentry-add-support-for)).
 * `Grant-Permission` now supports creating `Deny` access rules. Use the new `Type` parameter. [Fixes issue #152.](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/152)
 * `Set-EnvironmentVariable`: 
   * Added `-Force` switch to make all variable modifications immediately visible in the current PowerShell process's `env:` drive. Restarts are no longer required.
   * You can now set an environment variable for other users. Use the `Credential` parameter to specify the user's credentials. [Fixes issue #151.](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/151)
 * `Remove-EnvironmentVariable`: 
   * Added `-Force` switch to make all variable removals immediately visible in the current PowerShell process's `env:` drive. Restarts are no longer required.
   * You can now remove variables from multiple targets/scopes at once.
   * You can now remove an environment variable for other users. Use the `Credential` parameter to specify the user's credentials.
 * `Invoke-PowerShell`:
   * It now runs PowerShell commands. Pass a string of PowerShell code with the `Command` parameter. 
   * It now runs encoded PowerShell commands. Pass the string of PowerShell code with the `Command` parameter and use the `-Encode` switch.
   * It now runs scripts and commands as another user. Use the `Credential` parameter to pass the user's credentials along with the `FilePath` and `Command` parameters to run scripts and commands, respectively.
   
## Bug Fixes

 * Fixed: `Set-RegistryKeyValue` fails when `-String` parameter's value is `$null` or empty ([fixes issue #211](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/211/set-registrykeyvalue-null-string-invalid)).
 * Fixed: Can't import Carbon in a 32-bit PowerShell 4 session on a 64-bit operating system ([fixes issue #199](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/199/community-issue-importing-carbon-on-x64)).
 * Fixed: Documentation for the `Install-ScheduledTask` function's `HighestAvailableRunLevel` is lying ([fixes issue #205](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/205/documentation-install-scheduledtask-typo)).
 * Fixed: `Carbon_FirewallRule` fails when `Profile` property set to multiple values ([fixes issue #209](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/209/dsc-carbon_firewallrule-does-not-accept)).
 * Fixed: `Install-IisAppPool` can't set .NET framework version to `No Managed Code` ([fixes issue #210](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/210/install-iisapppool-need-to-be-able-to-set)).
 * Fixed: `Get-SslCertificateBinding` fails if the operating system's culture is not `en-US` ([fixes issue #171](https://bitbucket.org/splatteredbits/carbon/issues/171/get-sslcertificatebinding-fails-when-os)).
 * Fixed: `Install-ScheduledTask` fails when creating a task that runs during a specific week of the month on Sundays. (You're going to love this: the underlying int value for `[DayOfWeek]::Sunday` is `0`, so when testing if a `DayOfWeek` typed variable set to `Sunday` has a value, it returns `$false`. This made `Install-ScheduledTask` add the `/D` parameter without a value.
