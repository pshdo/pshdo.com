Pshdo (*shoo-doo*) is centered around [PowerShell](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx), Microsoft's awesome task automation framework and command shell. The name is a play on the Unix `sudo` command.

Owned and operated by [Aaron Jensen](http://splatteredbits.com), a Configuration Management/DevOps/Build Architect in Portland, Oregon. I've been writing software since 1998 and automating everything he can since 2009. He created and maintains the [Carbon](http://get-carbon.org) and [Blade](http://get-blade.org/) open-source PowerShell modules.
