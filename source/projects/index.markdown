## Carbon

## Blade

[Blade](http://get-blade.org) is an open source, NUnit-inspired testing PowerShell module for testing PowerShell modules, functions, and scripts. It is used by the [Carbon](http://get-carbon.org), [PsHg](http://bitbucket.org/webmd/pshg), and [Rivet](http://bitbucket.org/webmd/rivet) projects. I wrote it before I knew about [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester). Now I have so many tests that it would be burdensome to switch.

## Rivet

[Rivet](http://bitbucket.org/webmd/rivet) is an open source, SQL Server database migration tool. Database changes are scripted using PowerShell. Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations.

## PsHg

[PsHg](http://bitbucket.org/webmd/pshg) is an open source PowerShell module for automating [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com).
