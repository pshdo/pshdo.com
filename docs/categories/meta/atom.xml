    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Feburary 2011, I finally got tired of using MSBuild as a scripting language.  There are great frameworks out there that make it bearable, but trying to use a build language to script and program is a recipe for disaster and bloated scripts.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what finally motivated me to learn PowerShell.  I ordered every PowerShell book from the library, but returned them as soon as I started Lee Holmes' <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528492.do">PowerShell Cookbook</a>. Within a few days, I was writing scripts.  A year later, I have a hard time writing MSBuild.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still kicking myself for waiting as long as I did.  I had heard lots of respectable developers extol PowerShell, but I never set aside the time to learn it.  What a waste.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a .NET developer, and still using cmd as your command prompt, or even worse cygwin (shudder), shame on you!  Take a deep breath, two days off, and read Lee Holmes' book.  You&rsquo;ll never look back.</p>
